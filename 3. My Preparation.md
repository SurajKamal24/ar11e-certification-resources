# My Preparation

- **Reactive apps in OutSystems**
    1. Client variables - configuration, long lived, user specific, browser. basic data types except binary. kept on login, rest on logout, closing doesn’t lose. Avoid sensitive or confidential. Caching (username) , configuration (search keyword). Client.ClientVariableNam
    2. Screen lifecycle - 
        1. On Initialize - after permission check. DOM not loaded, Initialize default data. Aggregates starts after initialize. In blocks after navigation
        2. On Ready - Happens only when opening the screen
        3. On Render - Happens every time the data of the screen is modified. No explicit refresh
        4. On Destroy - Navigation from one screen to another. DOM of both screen exists. The DOM of the old screen removed only after the render event of the new screen
        5. On After fetch - Occurs after aggregate or data action. But before the render event. Only in aggregate or data action and not on screens or blocks. **In the master-detail pattern, to iterate a query to populate a list of lists.**
    3. On parameters changed event - Occurs in BLOCK,  **parent Screen or Block changes one of its input parameters. Changes to the input value inside the block do not trigger this event handler. You can use it to react to changes in the Block parameters, such as to update variables. Refresh an Aggregate or Data Action that depends on that input parameter. Recalculate a variable that depends on the input parameter.**
    4. Fetch property 
        1. At start - default. Asynchronous and parallel, screen initializing
        2. On demand - Programmatically refresh aggregates
        3. Example
            1. GetCountries → On after fetch → GetStates. 
            2. Dropdown - variabale → to store, list (GetCountries.List) → to retrieve, options text (display) - Country.Label, options value (use internally) - Country.Id 
    5. Debugger
        1. Properties - continue, step over, step into, step out, 
        2. mobile - emulator on browser
        3. Entry module - consumer module of producer module to stop on the breakpoints. Service action - this module as entry module
        4. Producer module - functionality exposed by another module. When you are debugging a producer Module the debugger will not stop in any breakpoints set in the consumer Module unless you also start a debug session in the consumer Module.
        5. UTC date time
        6. public client and server actions 
    6. Monitoring service center - Tabs
        1. monitoring → errors, general, screen actions, service actions
- **Data Modeling**
    1. Many to many relationships - junction entity or third entity - it’s own identifier and two reference attributes, automatic joins
    2. Entity identifier - Data type (text, integer, long integer or other entity identifier), auto number (yes or no), mandatory (yes), default value
    3. Bootstrap scenarios
    4. Read only entity property
    5. Static entities
    6. Attributes and entities
    7. Entity functions
    8. Delete rule property of referenced attribute
- **Fetching data**
    1. Advanced aggregates - Join, aggregation attributes, new calculated attributes
    2. Multiple sources and joins
    3. Group by and count or sum
    4. Pagination logic - Properties, variables and refresh
- **Logic**
    1. Built in validation property - Three scenarios. Mandatory fields and data type (what about text length)
    2. Switch 
    3. Exceptions - User Defined, Database and security
    4. Client action as function
    5. Form validations - Built in validation property
    6. Form values storage
    7. Client action and server action properties - public, function
    8. Input and label
    9. Client action as expression
    10. Entity actions output
    11. Client and server actions
        1. Public - **Set to Yes to allow the element to be added as dependency by other modules.**
        2. Function **Set to Yes to define the action as a function. Functions must return a value and can be used in expressions. This property is only available in global scope actions. Client actions set as functions can only be used in client action expressions.**
- **UI Design**
    1. Blocks - reusable, widgets, patterns and other blocks. Own scope, input parameters, local variables, and screen actions. No output parameters Screens, other blocks, no nested blocks, parameters, role based access block
        1. **On Parameters Changed - Action to be executed when the value of an input parameter of this element changes.**
    2. Trigger Event - Block to parent. Two things trigger and handle event
    3. Dropdown - Properties
    4. Button - On click properties - screen external link, client action
    5. List properties
    6. Button group - properties 
    7. Buttons vs link properties - Onclick mandatory. Event - JavaScript
- **Architecture & Security**
    1. Roles and screen access
        1. Anonymous registered
        2. check, grant and revoke.
        3. Managing - users app, programmatically
        4. programmatically Only in server actions not in client actions or screen actions
        5. screen actions with properties
        6. **Persistent: The runtime granting or revoking of Roles is stored in the database and is kept in between login sessions. Set the `Is Persistent` property of the Role to `Yes`.Not persistent: The runtime granting or revoking of Roles is not stored in the database, lasting only for a single session. When the end-user is logged out, the runtime granting or revoking of Roles is lost. Set the `Is Persistent` property of the Role to `No`.**
        7. **`Check<role_name>Role` expressions**
    2. Module types - reactive, blank, service, library, extension
    3. Modules - The module that implements and exposes functionality is the **producer** module. On the other hand, the module that reuses the exposed functionality is the **consumer** module. The functionality exposed by a **producer** module is considered as **dependencies** in the **consumers**.
        1. How to expose - Public property to yes and not enabled by default. By definition, Service Actions are always public to other modules, so you don't need to set them as public. This also happens for the elements exposed by [Extensions](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/integration_with_external_systems/extend_logic_with_your_own_code/extensions/).
        2. immediate effect or republised. Weak dependency vs strong dependency
        3. Dependencies - Refresh module when impacted dependencies
